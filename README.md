# BadUSB4PinBrute
A ducky script to brute force 4 digit pins on newer phones.


I bought a flipper zero and was testing the badusb scripts and found the default ones don't really do much when attacking modern devices. This current script has been tested against a Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 Ultra. I have plans to test against some IOS devices in the future.

This script utlizies common 4 digit pins. I have plans in the future to have seperate scripts for differenet number ranges, because theses attacks can really take a long time to complete.

**I'm telling you its slow... fair warning! Maybe one day I'll be able to get them to go faster.**
